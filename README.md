# Getting Started

### Description

This microservice is implemented to demonstrate spring cloud concepts.This implementation utilised below concepts
1. Eureka discovery server
2. Circuitbreaker using resilience4j (hysterix project is shutdown. reseilience is the replacement for hysterix)
3. API Gateway
4. Distributed tracing using zipkin
5. Tracer library using micrometer brave (Slueth is deprecated from spring boot 3.0.0 release)
